# Legendres3DGraphSolver

This repository contains a web-based interactive 3D graphing tool for visualizing solutions to Legendre's three-square theorem. The tool allows users to input a number and generates a 3D plot of solutions using Plotly.js. Features include toggling edges, drawing circles for points on the same Y-axis, allowing negative numbers, and adjustable axis range. An animation feature iteratively finds and displays solutions for consecutive numbers.

Haven't seen this done before. Creates some very interesting symmetries! Check out numbers 43802 or 250838
